## Code

### Statements

`a = b * 2;` a statement

### Expressions

`2` literal value expression  
`b` variable expression  
`b * 2` arithmetic expression  
`a = b * 2` assignment expression  

`b * 2` expression statement (not useful)

### Executing a Program

translation of code:  
every time the program is run -> interpreting  
ahead of time -> compiling  

JavaScript engines -> compile on the fly, immediately run

### Input

```js
age = prompt( "Please tell me your age:" );
console.log( age );
```
